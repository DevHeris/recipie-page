      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    Instructions
  
    : 
  
    Heat the pan: 
  
    : Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
    the eggs evenly coat the surface.
  
    Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
  
    Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
  
    Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
