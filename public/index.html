    <!-- Simple Omelette Recipe

    An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked 
    to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.
  
    Preparation time
  
    Total: Approximately 10 minutes
    Preparation: 5 minutes
    Cooking: 5 minutes
  
    Ingredients
  
    2-3 large eggs
    Salt, to taste
    Pepper, to taste
    1 tablespoon of butter or oil
    Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
  
    Instructions
  
    Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
  
    Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
  
    Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
    the eggs evenly coat the surface.
  
    Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
  
    Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
  
    Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
